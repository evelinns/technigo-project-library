Project showcasing recipe cards based on information from an array.

- On pageload you are met with all recipe cards, use the filterings by cuisine type or time to cook to filter accordingly.
- Initial part of the work was to style it in line with the figma design file provided. This was then followed by updating information on the page based on how the user interacts with it and also using information from the recipes array to generate content on the page.
- If I had more time I would work more on animations when different things are happening on the page.
